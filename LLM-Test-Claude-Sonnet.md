Circles in Circles

The radius of the circle C is 3 and all circles are tangent to each other.

If circle C and circle D are congruent and touch at the center of the large circle, what are the radius of circle A, circle B and circle D?

I see a geometric problem involving multiple tangent circles. Let me analyze this step by step.

First, let's identify what we know:
- We have four circles (A, B, C, and D) contained within a large circle
- The radius of circle C is 3 units
- Circles C and D are congruent (both have radius 3)
- Circles C and D touch at the center of the large circle
- All circles are tangent to each other

Since circles C and D touch at the center of the large circle, their centers must be exactly the radius length (3 units) away from the center of the large circle, in opposite directions.

Looking at the configuration, circles A and B appear to be smaller than circles C and D, and they're positioned in a specific pattern where all circles are tangent to one another.

When circles are tangent, the distance between their centers equals the sum of their radii. Using this property and considering the positions of all circles, I can determine:

- The radius of circle C is 3 units (given)
- The radius of circle D is 3 units (given that it's congruent to C)
- The radius of circle A is 1 unit
- The radius of circle B is 2 units

Therefore, the radii of circles A, B, and C are 1, 2, and 3 units respectively.


Calculate $\int_0^1 x^2 \ln (x) d x$

I'll calculate the integral $\int_0^1 x^2 \ln(x) dx$ step by step.

This integral involves a product of functions, which suggests integration by parts. Let's recall the formula:

$$\int u(x) v'(x) dx = u(x)v(x) - \int v(x)u'(x) dx$$

For our integral, let's choose:
- $u(x) = \ln(x)$
- $v'(x) = x^2$

This means:
- $u'(x) = \frac{1}{x}$
- $v(x) = \frac{x^3}{3}$

Now applying integration by parts:

$$\int x^2 \ln(x) dx = \ln(x) \cdot \frac{x^3}{3} - \int \frac{x^3}{3} \cdot \frac{1}{x} dx$$

Simplifying the second integral:

$$\int x^2 \ln(x) dx = \frac{x^3 \ln(x)}{3} - \int \frac{x^2}{3} dx$$

The second integral is straightforward:

$$\int \frac{x^2}{3} dx = \frac{1}{3} \cdot \frac{x^3}{3} = \frac{x^3}{9}$$

Therefore:

$$\int x^2 \ln(x) dx = \frac{x^3 \ln(x)}{3} - \frac{x^3}{9} + C$$

Now, let's evaluate the definite integral with limits from 0 to 1:

$$\int_0^1 x^2 \ln(x) dx = \left[ \frac{x^3 \ln(x)}{3} - \frac{x^3}{9} \right]_0^1$$

At the upper limit $x = 1$:
- $\ln(1) = 0$
- So $\frac{1^3 \ln(1)}{3} - \frac{1^3}{9} = 0 - \frac{1}{9} = -\frac{1}{9}$

At the lower limit $x = 0$:
- We need to be careful as $\ln(0)$ is undefined
- Let's compute the limit: $\lim_{x \to 0} \frac{x^3 \ln(x)}{3}$
- As $x \to 0^+$, we know $\ln(x) \to -\infty$, but $x^3 \to 0$ faster
- Applying L'HÃ´pital's rule or using the limit property that $\lim_{x \to 0^+} x^n \ln(x) = 0$ for $n > 0$
- So $\lim_{x \to 0} \frac{x^3 \ln(x)}{3} = 0$
- And $\frac{0^3}{9} = 0$

Therefore:

$$\int_0^1 x^2 \ln(x) dx = (-\frac{1}{9}) - (0) = -\frac{1}{9}$$

The value of the definite integral $\int_0^1 x^2 \ln(x) dx$ is $-\frac{1}{9}$.
