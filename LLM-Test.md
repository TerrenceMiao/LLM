A marble is put in a glass. The glass is then turned upside down and put on a table. Then the glass is picked up and put in a microwave. Where's the marble? Explain your reasoning step by step.
---

Let's think through this step-by-step:

1. Initial state: A marble is put in a glass.

2. The glass is turned upside down:
   - When the glass is turned upside down, gravity will cause the marble to fall to the bottom of the glass (which is now the top, since it's inverted).

3. The upside-down glass is put on a table:
   - The marble is now resting on the table, trapped under the inverted glass.

4. The glass is picked up:
   - When the glass is lifted, the marble will remain on the table. It won't stick to the glass or move with it.

5. The glass is put in a microwave:
   - The glass is moved to the microwave, but the marble is left behind on the table.

Conclusion: The marble is on the table where the glass was originally placed.

Reasoning: The key point in this sequence is when the upside-down glass is lifted from the table. Gravity keeps the marble on the table's surface, while the glass is moved away. The subsequent action of putting the glass in the microwave doesn't affect the marble's position because the marble and glass are no longer in contact with each other.

Translate "its competitors are selling sizzle and Google offers warmed-up cow" into Chinese.
---

Here's a translation of that phrase into Chinese:

"它的竞争对手在卖噱头，而谷歌只提供平淡无奇的东西。"

This translation attempts to capture the essence of the original English idiom. Here's a breakdown:

1. "它的竞争对手" means "its competitors"
2. "在卖噱头" means "are selling sizzle" (literally "selling gimmicks" or "selling hype")
3. "而谷歌" means "while Google"
4. "只提供平淡无奇的东西" means "only offers something plain and ordinary"

The last part is an idiomatic translation of "warmed-up cow." In Chinese, there isn't a direct equivalent to this English expression, so I've translated it to convey the meaning of something unexciting or ordinary.

9.9 and 9.11, which one is bigger?
---

Let's compare these two numbers step by step:

1. Both numbers have the same whole number part (9), so we need to look at the decimal part to determine which is larger.

2. For 9.9:
   - The decimal part is 0.9
   - This can be written as 0.90 in expanded form

3. For 9.11:
   - The decimal part is 0.11

4. When comparing decimals, we can compare each decimal place from left to right:
   - In the tenths place (first decimal place):
     9.9 has 9
     9.11 has 1
   - 9 is greater than 1

5. Since the tenths place of 9.9 is greater than the tenths place of 9.11, we don't need to look any further.

Conclusion: 9.9 is bigger than 9.11.

This might seem counterintuitive at first because we're used to thinking that 11 is greater than 9. However, in decimal notation, the position of the digits is crucial. In this case, 0.9 represents nine-tenths, which is greater than 0.11, which represents eleven-hundredths.
