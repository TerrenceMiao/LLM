Friends star Matthew Perry has died in an apparent drowning accident aged 54.

Emergency services were called to his Los Angeles home on Saturday, reportedly after an assistant found him unresponsive.

An LA Fire Department spokesman confirmed that their first responders had been called just after 4pm for a “water rescue or water emergency”, but the body of water involved was not specified.

No foul play is suspected.

A source told TMZ the star had been found in a hot tub, while shortly after another told the US site that he had just returned home from a game of pickleball.

“We responded to the 1800 block of Blue Sail Rd for a death investigation on a male [at] 4:10 pm this afternoon,” LA police confirmed.

“He was in his 50s.”
