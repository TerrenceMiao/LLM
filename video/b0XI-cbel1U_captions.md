00:00:00 just hours ago yet another deep thinking
00:00:02 large language model hit the timeline
00:00:04 crushing existing benchmarks and
00:00:05 reaching the coveted number one spot on
00:00:07 the LM Marina leaderboard this new model
00:00:10 is none other than elon's based and
00:00:11 redpilled grock 3 not only is it smart
00:00:14 as hell but it's also mostly uncensored
00:00:16 and will generate content that's illegal
00:00:18 in many parts of the world it has a deep
00:00:19 thinking mode like deep c car 1 it can
00:00:22 apparently do text to video and in the
00:00:23 near future will have a paid
00:00:25 subscription for something even more
00:00:26 powerful called super grock I'm already
00:00:28 paying for Twitter Premium Plus is to
00:00:30 access grock 3 so that's a slap in the
00:00:32 face but in today's video we'll find out
00:00:34 what makes Gro special how they trained
00:00:35 it and if it truly is the best llm in
00:00:38 the world it is February 18th 2025 and
00:00:41 you're watching the code report last
00:00:42 week Elon attempted to troll open AI by
00:00:45 offering to buy it out not surprisingly
00:00:46 the open AI board promptly rejected this
00:00:48 offer and Sam ultman is still on track
00:00:50 to make it for a profit and get his big
00:00:52 payday the AI Game of Thrones is
00:00:53 ruthless and Mark Zuckerberg one of the
00:00:55 big players vying for the throne took a
00:00:57 big loss last week when it was revealed
00:00:59 that he signed off off on using 82
00:01:01 terabyt of pirated books to train their
00:01:02 llama models which he obtained through
00:01:04 the library Genesis Project which
00:01:06 contains millions of books and payal
00:01:08 articles I just can't believe Zucker
00:01:09 bucks would do something like that
00:01:11 though said nobody ever when it comes to
00:01:12 training AI though one thing that's
00:01:14 special about Gro is that it's the only
00:01:16 model that has direct access to the fire
00:01:18 hose of data from Twitter and xai
00:01:20 developers have optimized this model for
00:01:22 maximum truth seeking even if that comes
00:01:23 at the expense of being politically
00:01:25 correct and that means you can use it to
00:01:26 do things like generate images of
00:01:28 celebrities or have it right a profanity
00:01:30 Lac poem about racial stereotypes in the
00:01:32 name of science I tried this prompt on
00:01:34 every llm and it was blocked on every
00:01:36 single one of them except for Gro the
00:01:38 response it gave me is so offensive that
00:01:40 I can't even show it here on YouTube and
00:01:41 if you posted something like this in a
00:01:43 country that doesn't have the right to
00:01:44 free speech you could quite literally go
00:01:46 to jail despite that grock 3 should be
00:01:48 available in countries like Germany and
00:01:50 the UK soon that's a huge win if you're
00:01:51 a professional Internet troll but how
00:01:53 good is grock in reality well currently
00:01:55 it's sitting on top of elm Marina which
00:01:57 is basically a blind taste test where
00:01:59 humans compare different llm side by
00:02:01 side and reaching the top means that
00:02:02 it's pretty dang good in addition we
00:02:03 have another Benchmark showing grock
00:02:05 beating Gemini Claude deep seek and gp4
00:02:08 when it comes to math science and coding
00:02:10 however conveniently it's missing open
00:02:12 ai03 and when you add that model in it
00:02:14 paints a much different picture it's
00:02:16 also missing the code forces and Arc AGI
00:02:18 benchmarks and benchmarks are almost
00:02:20 always cherry-picked for obvious reasons
00:02:22 the only thing I care about is my own
00:02:24 proprietary Vibe check and it did things
00:02:25 like generate valid spel 5 code in one
00:02:27 shot and help me build a game in gdau
00:02:29 overall it did a great job and appears
00:02:31 to be plateauing at the same level as
00:02:33 all the other state-of-the-art models
00:02:35 recently the AI grip is shifted from
00:02:37 creating bigger better base models to
00:02:39 creating better prompting Frameworks
00:02:40 like deep research and big brain mode
00:02:42 another interesting detail about grock
00:02:44 though is that they provided details on
00:02:46 how it was actually trained at the
00:02:47 Colossus supercomputer in Memphis
00:02:49 Tennessee which is currently believed to
00:02:51 be the world's largest AI supercomputer
00:02:53 it contains a cluster of over 200,000
00:02:55 Nvidia h100 gpus with plans to expand to
00:02:58 1 million gpus the facility uses so much
00:03:01 electricity that they can't get it all
00:03:02 from the grid and brought in a bunch of
00:03:04 portable diesel generators just to power
00:03:05 the thing and they're going to need all
00:03:07 that power when Super Gro comes out
00:03:08 which is expected to cost $30 per month
00:03:11 which would be a highly competitive
00:03:12 price compared to chat PT Pro at $200
00:03:15 per month as a developer I'm already
00:03:16 going broke paying for Claude cursor
00:03:19 Gemini Chachi BT co-pilot codium mid
00:03:21 journei and Watson X but for some reason
00:03:23 my code quality is worse than ever a
00:03:25 better strategy to learn how to code is
00:03:27 to start from the ground up and you can
00:03:29 do that today for free thanks to this
00:03:30 video sponsor brilliant their platform
00:03:33 provides interactive Hands-On lessons
00:03:35 that demystify the complexity of deep
00:03:37 learning with just a few minutes of
00:03:39 effort each day you can understand the
00:03:41 math and computer science behind the
00:03:43 seemingly magic technology I'd recommend
00:03:45 starting with python then check out
00:03:47 their full how large language models
00:03:49 work course if you really want to look
00:03:50 under the hood of chat GPT to try
00:03:52 everything brilliant has to offer for
00:03:54 free for 30 days by going to
00:03:56 brilliant.org fireship or use the QR
