**Introduction to Grock 3**
just hours ago yet another deep thinking large language model hit the timeline, crushing existing benchmarks and reaching the coveted number one spot on the LM Marina leaderboard. This new model is none other than Elon's based and redpilled Grock 3, which is not only smart but also mostly uncensored and will generate content that's illegal in many parts of the world.

**Recent Developments in AI**
it is February 18th, 2025, and you're watching the code report. Last week, Elon attempted to troll Open AI by offering to buy it out, but the Open AI board promptly rejected this offer. The AI Game of Thrones is ruthless, and Mark Zuckerberg, one of the big players vying for the throne, took a big loss last week when it was revealed that he signed off on using 82 terabytes of pirated books to train their Llama models.

**Grock's Unique Features**
one thing that's special about Grock is that it's the only model that has direct access to the firehose of data from Twitter and XAI. Developers have optimized this model for maximum truth-seeking, even if that comes at the expense of being politically correct. This means you can use it to do things like generate images of celebrities or have it write a profanity-laced poem about racial stereotypes in the name of science.

**Benchmarks and Performance**
currently, Grock 3 is sitting on top of the LM Marina leaderboard, which is basically a blind taste test where humans compare different LLMs side by side. In addition, Grock 3 has beaten Gemini, Claude, Deep Seek, and GP4 when it comes to math, science, and coding. However, conveniently, it's missing Open AI 03, and when you add that model in, it paints a much different picture.

**Training and Supercomputing**
recently, the AI grip has shifted from creating bigger, better base models to creating better prompting frameworks like Deep Research and Big Brain Mode. Another interesting detail about Grock is that they provided details on how it was actually trained at the Colossus supercomputer in Memphis, Tennessee, which is currently believed to be the world's largest AI supercomputer.

**Super Grock and Pricing**
Super Grock is expected to cost $30 per month, which would be a highly competitive price compared to Chat PT Pro at $200 per month. As a developer, the speaker is already going broke paying for various AI tools, but for some reason, their code quality is worse than ever. A better strategy to learn how to code is to start from the ground up, and you can do that today for free thanks to the video sponsor, Brilliant.
