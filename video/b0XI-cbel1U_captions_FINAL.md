Here is a summarized version of the transcript with timestamps:

**Introduction to Grock 3 (00:00:00 - 00:00:41)**
A new large language model called Grock 3 has been released, which is based on Elon's technology and has reached the top spot on the LM Marina leaderboard. It has a deep thinking mode and can generate text-to-video content.

**Background on AI Development (00:00:42 - 00:01:14)**
The AI development space is highly competitive, with companies like Open AI and Meta vying for dominance. Elon attempted to buy out Open AI, but the offer was rejected. Mark Zuckerberg's company was also involved in a controversy surrounding the use of pirated books to train their AI models.

**Grock 3's Unique Features (00:01:14 - 00:02:25)**
Grock 3 has direct access to Twitter and XAI data, which allows it to generate more truthful responses, even if they are not politically correct. It can also generate images of celebrities and write profanity-laced poems about racial stereotypes.

**Benchmarks and Performance (00:02:25 - 00:03:08)**
Grock 3 is currently at the top of the LM Marina leaderboard and has performed well in other benchmarks, such as math, science, and coding. However, it is missing from some other benchmarks, and its performance may not be as strong when compared to other models like Open AI 03.

**Training and Hardware (00:02:46 - 00:03:08)**
Grock 3 was trained on the Colossus supercomputer in Memphis, Tennessee, which is one of the largest AI supercomputers in the world. The facility uses a massive amount of electricity to power its 200,000+ Nvidia H100 GPUs.

**Future Plans and Pricing (00:03:08 - 00:03:16)**
A new version of Grock 3 called Super Gro is expected to be released, which will cost $30 per month. This is a competitive price compared to other AI models like Chat PT Pro.

**Conclusion and Sponsorship (00:03:16 - 00:04:02)**
The video concludes by discussing the importance of learning to code from the ground up, rather than relying on AI models. The sponsor, Brilliant, is introduced, which provides interactive lessons and courses on deep learning and computer science.
